# PCF-generator
Prime and composite number generator that can also list factors of composite numbers previously generated.
The program asks the user if they want to generate a list of all the prime or composite numbers less than N, where N could be an integer greater than 3.
The user also has the option to sort the list of numbers from least to greatest or greatest to least. 
If the user decides to generate a list of composite numbers, the program will output the number of divisors to rhe right of each composite number seperated by a comma.
The user could also choose whether they want to sort the list of composite numbers according to their actual value or the number of factors each composite number has. 
The program will also ask the user which composite number generated do they want all the factors of listed from least to greatest.
